By definition, automation is a technology by which a process can be performed with minimal human intervention1.
Using advancement in technology and the extreme low cost of building and deploying software tools to perform routine rule-based service processes, organisations are achieving tremendous productivity gains. Intelligently put together teams of software robots and human employees can cut down costs, reduce time to respond and increase customer satisfaction.


There are three different type of process automation basic, intermediate and advanced. In this article we will look at how automation can help improve front office or back office rule-based processes. Provide use cases, with how it helped organizations improve their processes and reduce costs.

### Basic
In this context automation help a user perform tasks that can improve productivity. An example would be taking a PDF file dropping it into a program that converts it into an Excel, based on predefined rules. Now in this instance a single user is leveraging a piece of software to simplify their processing that they would have otherwise been doing it manually by data entry into an Excel sheet.

### Intermediate
This is where it gets really interesting, compared to basic process automation, where a single task was automated , intermediate process automation takes a whole process and automate it. There are multiple steps/tasks in the process and based on predefined rules and structured data we design our robot to perform each step as specified.
Robotic process automation falls under this category.
As an example consider retail stores sending out scans of daily inventory reports. Support staff receive reports and process the data. With RPA we can get the scan extract the data perform data entry into the target system and in the process identify if the data falls into the normal range in which case process moves on as usual or if the data is outside of normal range in that instance rather than entering the data we create an alert and involve a human worker.
### Advanced
Advanced process automation take solving problems of the next level. This level of process automation has cognitive abilities and intelligence to make complex decisions. Artificial intelligence plays a crucial role at this level. We are looking at training an algorithm to understand the processes understand the data the processes are creating and make appropriate decisions.
For a manufacturer there's a tremendous amount of data the manufacturing devices are creating we can train our algorithm to look at the outcome of each end product. For example, looking the dimensions our algorithm is smart enough to know the normal range of variances of that dimension at any point the data lies outside of the the variance we know there is a need for intervention. At that point our trained robot can start creating alerts and get service teams involved. In cases where this range becomes problematic, the robot is smart enough morning to shut down the process to avoid damage to the system or creating defective products.

At __Eclate__ our team of talented resources have tremendous amount of experience designing and implementing software with automation capabilities. We have used off the shelf software like UIpath and Blue Prism, as well as build custom bot applications with
